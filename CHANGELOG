1.0.13
 * Do not register temp files with DeleteOnExit, as this will cause an java heap space OOM eventually
1.0.12
 * Do not initialise tapes twice

1.0.11
 * Only create a new tape after we have checked the newest tape... Stupid bug

1.0.10
 * Fixed the error that would appear in the log if the archive was closed. Now closing require the WriteLock, meaining that it waits for the taper thread.
 * Added a more comprehensive test

1.0.9
 * Fixed a bad bug that would instantly corrupt the tapes when an object/datastream was deleted

1.0.8
 * Filenames of tar tapes is no longer url encoded since it caused trouble with long datastream names
 * Ensure that open files are closed even upon errors

1.0.7
 * The 1.0.6 release changed the names of the files inside the tar tapes to be url encoded. This was to ensure that
 extraction would not cause filesystems problems. However, this broke the ability to read old tapes. This release allow
 the system to read old tapes transparently, but will url encode the names of all new files added to tapes.

1.0.6
 * Generalised a lot of the file handling to make the code more maintainable
 * Fixed the config file to be more Drift friendly
 * Reorganised the class names to make them more understandable
 * Zipping logic moved to TapeUtils
 * The testNg suite cleans up after run
 * Fixed so that we have a two-stage commit of the cache files. First we move the file from the temp folder to the cache folder under a name prefixed with new_. Then we delete the file in cache and move the new_ file to the correct name
 * Always create a new tape when starting up, as this prevents issues with junk in the end of the previous one. This junk is ignored when it is indexed, just leading to a warning in the log now
 * Do not fail hard on init if a tape cannot be read. Rather, log an error and ignore anything further in that tape
 * More intelligent append with the use of a file length counter
 * Do not delete the source file if the taping fails. This was a serious bug
 * Jedis can now be configured from spring. Reasonable defaults to prevent connection timeouts

1.0.5
 * Fixed bad and stupid bug about tape extentions. This means that the properties "tapeExtention", "tapePrefix" and "tapeTempPrefix" is now constructor params, rather than properties.
 * The Timer thread is now a daemon, so the system should be able to shut down.

1.0.4
 * Fixed stupid bug regarding tape prefix


1.0.3
 * Tape filename prefix and extension are now configurable


1.0.2
 * No longer nullPointerexceptions from DeferringTaper when trying to report errors.

1.0.1
 * Use 1.0 doms parent pom

1.0
 * Initial release
